<h2>Films</h2>
<p> My favourite films are: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Hot Fuzz</li>
    <li>Django Unchained</li>
    <li>Perks of being a wallflower</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Baking</h2>
<p>I really enjoy baking because it's relaxing for me and you're able to create lots of delicious stuff. I mainly use <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/chocolate-cake-recipes">BBC Good Food</a> recipes because they are easy to make</p>
<h2>Fireworks</h2>
<p>I also enjoy fireworks because they are pretty to look at and fun to set off</p>
